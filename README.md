# SEAI — Self-Evolving AI Architecture

This project implements a Self-Evolving AI Architecture (SEAI) for concept drift detection and adaptive model updating using:

- Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
- Adaptive Transformer Models
- Drift Detection
- Continual Learning (Replay + EWC)
- Meta Initialization
- Streaming Experiments
